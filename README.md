# Software Development and Life-Cycle
## Project Lifecycles 

### Waterfall 
#### The Waterfall model is a linear software lifecycle in which the progress flows in one direction downwards. This occurs through phases of Requirements Definitions, System and Software Design, Implentation and unit testing, Intergration and system testing and Operation and maintenenace. 
### Prototyping 
#### Prototyping is the activity of creating prototypes of software applications such as incomplete versions of the software. It is used to visualize some component of the software to limit misunderstanding between the development team and the client. 
### Evolutionary 
#### Evolutionary is a form of Software Prototyping. The goal of Evolutionary is to create a robust prototype and constantly refine it. This is refined through Client feedback. 
### Spiral 
#### The Spiral model is the combination of the Waterfall method and the Prototyping method. It combines elements of both design and Prototyping-in-stages. This model uses the same order as the Waterfall however, it is seperated by planning, risk assesment and the building of prototypes and simulations. 

### How is risk mamaged in the Spiral model ?
#### The Spiral models main aspect is focusing on risks. Every aspect of the product and work becomes transparent as it is all a secondary action. After the initial design and development stage there is a massive risk assessment stage. This is where every possible risk is monitored and mediated. This is also a continuation of the entire model. If the risks are sorted out in first priority it can mediate a lot of wasted time. The model is very adaptive. Rather than managing risks after development and possibly wasting time on unnecessary work, the spiral model mediates this before development.

### Feasibility Report
#### The Feasibility report is the second document created in a business case. It is a breakdown of the different variables involved and how they will be accepted in the market along with who the target audience is and what sector of the market it is targeting. It essentially explores the different avenues the project can target and analyses them. It will generally have a layout like so;

#### Proposed Project 
##### This is a summary of the project and its aims, objectives and costs. This will also layout time constraints.

#### Market Analysis
##### This is where the analysis of the projected market target takes place. The proposed target audience for the project will allow this to be narrowed to a specific demographic. From there they can see if it will be a profitable venture or if there needs to be some changes to the target audience to reach a different niche in that market area. 

#### Technical Feasibility 
##### This covers whether the estimated costs, time, and resources of the technical aspects will make the venture profitable. 

#### Financial Feasibility 
##### This is a major breakdown and summary of the finances in the project. This is all of the costs from marketing to technical resources. This will then be compared with an estimated profit figure to calculate whether the venture will be profitable or how profitable it will be.


### Technical Solutions Comparison
#### Technical solutions are compared on a set of constraints. Generally there will be many constraints so whichever solution meets the most or has the highest priority solutions but doesn’t meet the whole package will be chosen. These can be;

#### Suitability
##### This is whether or not it can solve the problem or it is a wasted venture. 

#### History
##### A technical solution that has been used before or is well known and established will be more reliable and efficient that a solution that has just finished development as they may still have unexpected testing errors they haven’t picked up on yet and could waste time. 

#### Support
##### This links in with history. If a solution is established it is likely to have a lot of error or general support. This can be from previous users or current one. This can also be true for closed and open source solutions. Closed source solutions will have in-house support and maybe not as many outside resources. Whereas Open source solutions will have a much wider base of input and could have a bigger and more active support committee. 

#### Sustainability 
##### The solution will have to meet the volume and requirements of the problem. If it is a long-term solution and there is a lot of projected growth can it handle the scalability in size in the future? 

#### Licensing
##### This mainly effects comparisons between open and closed software. The licensing of an open software could affect the usage as it can be against their terms. However they may have the best software to meet the solution. Closed software will generally have less conflicts with licensing and terms but they will generally have a greater cost.
