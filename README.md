# Project Lifecycles 

## Sequential

### Waterfall 
#### The Waterfall model is a linear software lifecycle in which the progress flows in one direction downwards. This occurs through phases of Requirements Definitions, System and Software Design, Implementation and unit testing, Integration and system testing and Operation and maintenance.

### V model
#### The V model is the same structure as the waterfall model. However, when it reaches the coding stage around system and software design instead of continuing in a linear stage, It bends upwards into testing and implementation.

## Iterative

### Evolutionary 
#### Evolutionary is a form of Software Prototyping. The goal of Evolutionary is to create a robust prototype and constantly refine it. This is refined through Client feedback. There will be an implement of an initial version that is shown to the client. Then feedback will be given and this will be put back through development and validation. Then there is a second and final version where the same cycle happens.

### Prototyping 
#### Prototyping is the activity of creating prototypes of software applications such as incomplete versions of the software. It is used to recognise some component of the software to limit misunderstanding between the development team and the client.

### Spiral 
#### The Spiral model is the combination of the Waterfall method and the Prototyping method. It combines elements of both design and Prototyping-in-stages. This model uses the same order as the Waterfall however, it is separated by planning, risk assessment and the building of prototypes and simulations.

### How is risk managed in the Spiral model?

#### The Spiral models main aspect is focusing on risks. Every aspect of the product and work becomes transparent as it is all a secondary action. Risks are conditions that can prevent the project from reaching its goals. After the initial design and development stage there is a massive risk assessment stage. This is where every possible risk is monitored and mediated. This is also a continued iteration of the entire model. If the risks are sorted out in first priority it can mediate a lot of wasted time and the risks are managed from trivial to fatal. This model is also very adaptive. Rather than managing risks after development and possibly wasting time on unnecessary work, the spiral model mediates this before development.

### Feasibility Report
#### The Feasibility report is the second document created in a business case. It is a breakdown of the different variables involved and how they will be accepted in the market along with who the target audience is and what sector of the market it is targeting. It essentially explores the different avenues the project can target and analyses them. It will generally have a layout like so;

#### Proposed Project 
##### This is a summary of the project and its aims, objectives, costs and time constraints. 

#### Market Analysis
##### This is where the analysis of the projected market target takes place. The proposed target audience for the project will allow this to be narrowed to a specific demographic. From there they can see if it will be a profitable venture or if there needs to be some changes to the target audience to reach a different niche in that market area. 

#### Technical Feasibility 
##### This covers whether the estimated costs, time, and resources of the technical aspects will make the venture profitable. This is also where the Functional and non-Functional requirements will be established. Additionally, there will also be an analysis on constraints. 

#### Financial Feasibility 
##### This is a major breakdown and summary of the finances in the project. This is all of the costs from marketing to technical resources. This will then be compared with an estimated profit figure to calculate whether the venture will be profitable or how profitable it will be.

#### Review
##### This is where the whole project will be summarized and analysed. This will be on topics like what project management framework to use, the software lifecycle and if there are any major constraints that can’t be mediated.

### Technical Solutions Comparison
#### Technical solutions are compared on a set of constraints. Generally, there will be many constraints so whichever solution meets the most or has the highest priority solutions but doesn’t meet the whole package will be chosen. Some constraints can be user and system requirements, features and functions. These can be interpreted into a layout like so;

#### Suitability/Purpose
##### This is whether or not it is appropriated for the solution required or has aspects that are appropriate.

#### History
##### A technical solution that has been used before or is well known and established will be more reliable and efficient that a solution that has just finished development as they may still have unexpected testing errors they haven’t picked up on yet and could waste time. 

#### Support
##### This links in with history. If a solution is established it is likely to have a lot of error or general support. This can be from previous users or current one. This can also be true for closed and open source solutions. Closed source solutions will have in-house support and maybe not as many outside resources. Whereas Open source solutions will have a much wider base of input and could have a bigger and more active support committee. 

#### Sustainability/Scalability 
##### The solution will have to meet the volume and requirements of the problem. If it is a long-term solution and there is a lot of projected growth can it handle the scalability in size in the future? 

#### Licensing/Availability
##### This mainly effects comparisons between open and closed software. The licensing of an open software could affect the usage as it can be against their terms. However, they may have the best software to meet the solution. Closed software will generally have less conflicts with licensing and terms but they will generally have a greater cost.

### Software Investigation
#### Tools
##### In our ZSL project we used a wide variety of tools and services.  
##### We used Google Drive to collaborate on documentation and to store our image assets and create presentations for client meetings. 
##### We used Shutter stock to source images and assets we weren’t creating ourselves. 
##### We used Unity as our main development platform. This also included using Visual Studio as they work in unison. 
##### We used a variety of image editors including Photoshop and Illustrator. 

#### Techniques
##### We used a variety of techniques for this project. Some of these are; 
##### Communication in meeting with the client. 
##### Time management in setting deadlines and a burn down chart. 
##### Evaluation and feedback in prototyping and testing. 
##### Creativity and decision making in design.

### Meeting Requirements
#### We translated the requirements set out by the client into Epics and User stories. This is part of the Agile Scrum project framework. The Epics are large requirements that can’t be divided into singular tasks. These are then split into user stories. These are descriptions of a feature from the user’s perspective. They generally follow this structure “As a < type of user >, I want < some goal > so that < some reason >. ".
