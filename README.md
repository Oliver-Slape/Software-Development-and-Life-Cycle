# Software Development and Life-Cycle
<h1> Project Lifecycles <h1>

<h3> Waterfall <h3>
<h4> The Waterfall model is a linear software lifecycle in which the progress flows in one direction downwards. 
This occurs through phases of Requirements Definitions, System and Software Design, Implentation and unit testing,
Intergration and system testing and Operation and maintenenace. <h4> 
<h3> Prototyping <h3>
<h4> Prototyping is the activity of creating prototypes of software applications such as incomplete versions of the software.
It is used to visualize some component of the software to limit misunderstanding between the development team and the client. <h4>
<h3> Evolutionary <h3>
<h4> Evolutionary is a form of Software Prototyping. The goal of Evolutionary is to create a robust prototype and constantly refine it.
This is refined through Client feedback. <h4>
<h3> Spiral <h3>
<h4> The Spiral model is the combination of the Waterfall method and the Prototyping method. It combines elements of both design and 
Prototyping-in-stages. This model uses the same order as the Waterfall however, it is seperated by planning, risk assesment and the building
of prototypes and simulations. <h4>

## How is risk mamaged in the Spiral model ?
### The Spiral models main aspect is focusing on risks. Every aspect of the product and work becomes transparent as it is all a secondary action. After the initial design and development stage there is a massive risk assessment stage. This is where every possible risk is monitored and mediated. This is also a continuation of the entire model. If the risks are sorted out in first priority it can mediate a lot of wasted time. The model is very adaptive. Rather than managing risks after development and possibly wasting time on unnecessary work, the spiral model mediates this before development.
